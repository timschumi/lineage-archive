    <h1>LineageOS Build Archive</h1>

    <p>
      This is a fallback version of the usual archive page.
      It only shows the files and metadata that are already uploaded to remote storage, with no way to upload anything automatically.
      It has no capability for verifying the information that it shows, so make sure that whatever you downloaded isn't a partially uploaded file.
